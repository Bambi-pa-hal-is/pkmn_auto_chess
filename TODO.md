# TODO

## Check in Auto Chess

Cost of dota auto chess upgraded units
    Level 2, type 4 -> sells for 6 (his level) +2 for now

## Backend

Move updates:
    Mana updates
        Move manaIncrease function logic to 2 functions
        One calculate mana changes and return the value
            Can also be used in move
        The other calculates newBoard from manaChanges calculated

No target move (splash) shouldnt deal damage (curr 1 it seems)

Information moving to get to frontend:
    Gold information calculation
        Move outside of function, calculate at gold changes and update frontend
        Maybe streak is received on frontend and everything can then be calculated there already?
    PlacePieceEvent:
        Types
        Which units to be sent back
    Type bonuses calculations, what combos are active
        Recalculate and update unitbuffs and boardBuffs on piece interactions
        Set on board units (not battle, already had)
            Every unit has buff or empty
        Set on left side of board, buffs
            boardBuffs
        Use this information, typeBuffs in the stats panel
            If type is buffed, show green + 25 for example at the hp for the unit

Handle empty boards for battle
    Should still visualize the enemy units

Pieces:
    Max 9 units for each player
        Fixes: Stop spawning units of certain type for player if has level 3

Aoe damage logic

Matchup system
    Moved to function but still needs logic figured out

first move

Finish abilities implementation (teleport)

ToggleLock Refactor: dispatch directly, dont interact with server (Easy spam)

Board css:
    pseduoElements :select 
    Fix z-index (or something) to place selected on top
        outline ugly, not on right side

        Timer click (close to 0)
        Unit upgrade

## Communication

If reconnected to server, update look to start layout
    If server disconnected mid game, make the user go back to main menu if game was cancelled

## Tests

More tests in general, easier to test in theory when frontend done

Test combos/buffs from types

Abilities: 
Test dot damage functionality
Test lifesteal functionality

## Code / Javascript Check me

Load / Set time factor better

Cache More Information
    Cache images/gifs (Store image, paddingTop, width and height, might not work)

Make elements % based instead of pixel based

Give information that playarea isn't in focus when it isn't
    Some error showing when hotkeys are availalbe or not

check Promise.all alternative for loops

.has instead of !f.isUndefined

cleanup async usage, using Promise.all in places where multÃ­ple calculations are needed
 makes it bottleneck on the slowest one
    example: 
    // Promise.all() allows us to send all requests at the same time. 
    let results = await Promise.all([ getValueA, getValueB, getValueC ]); 

## Cleanup / Refactor

Consistent naming of pokemon unit and piece (Unit preferred)

Separate logic into more files if possible

Remove unused variables in imports

Cleanup comments, better structure

Potential to use more functional code, map/filter

## Optional Features

Spinning wheel animating time between moves for all pokemon
    Easier to see when a unit does move

Login with name system
    Requires start page
    Starts game with player.name set for all players
        Display player.name instead of player.index in own name and enemy name during battle
        Also scoreboard show name
    Features for stored logins (same account every game):
        Login system
        Stats for player:
            Wins/Losses
            Favorite units possibility 

Crit
    Suggestion: 20% chance crit 1.5x damage

Type buffs - Add typebuffs from sheets directly

Shuffle deck of pieces when 20 (40?) pieces are discarded? Chance for not all pieces should be in every game

Shop: Modal?
    Allows for centering board and more dynamic layout

eevee:
    Currently: Random evolution
    Placement of eevees decides evolution!
    Evolution based on amount of unit types on board
    Temp: Random

## Balance

Strongest 1: 

Second wave 2 rattatas seem strong

Rhyhorn 4 -> 5?
Horsea 4 -> 3? Is dragon tho on kingdra
elekid 4 -> 3?
Check slowpoke - really slow

## New features to add (Not as core)

Find a way of choosing pokemon in play
    (Filtered list makes this less important)
    shouldn't play all 151 at once
    1: Ban base types in beginning
    2: Choose (20-40) units to start with

Automatic JSON download from google sheet

Fix working npm script to start both react and node server
    Currently requires two terminals, concurrent script not working

#### Rival: Rival battle when playing against a certain opponent
    > 3 battles
    Alt1: Either when playing against the person you played the most
        Temp implementation makes this irrelevant
    Alt2: The person you lost to the most 
        Problem: People won't be rivals against each other
    Alt1 Best: Revamp over enemy matchups should be done to make this interesting

#### Items

More inspiration can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoChess/comments/ar4cjh/pokemon_autochess_concept/)

1 item per pokemon

X-speed, attack etc

Rare Candy - 2 less pokemon required for 

leftovers/lifesteal functionality
    item / type buff

#### Npc rounds / Item rounds

Gym leader rounds:
    gives special item money,
    max 3 hp round loss
    can give item (low chance)

Shop rounds: 
    Buy items for item money in item shop

## Communication Schema: 

Client                  Server
player ready ->
            <- Amount of players ready
player unready ->
            <- Amount of players ready
startGame ->    
        <- Create initial state (init&start)
        <- Send it to all connected users
            Match socket with playerindex
            Mark time when it is battle time 
                (currentTime + 60)
toggleShop ->
    <- state
buyUnit ->
    <- state
refreshShop ->
    <- state
placePiece ->
    <- state
withdrawPiece ->
    <- state
When timer is out
Send state to server ->
        Build new state given from all users
        Decide what kind of battle is happening
        (pvp, pve, gymbattle)
        calculate battles, with opponents, and store moves
Meanwhile: Have a timer for like 5 sec or something show
        Calculate latest time to finish battle
    <-  Send moves to server
Timer=reached, assuming battle states are achieved,
Visualize battle
TODO: Check visualization speed is reasonable (multiply by factor otherwise)
Sounds etc
        time=reached => 
            <- State after battle, marked next battle time
                Check if players lost, mark correctly etc
