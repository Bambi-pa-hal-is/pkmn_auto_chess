## Check

Cost of dota auto chess upgraded units
    Equal to cost? 
    (3 doom -> doom level 2 -> cost = 12? Sell for 12?)
    
Level 9, chance for level 3 towers? (25% or 35%) (Says 35% but gives 110%)

How much hp to lose?

Shuffle deck of pieces when 20 (40?) pieces are discarded? Chance for not all pieces should be in every game

## General

Get all close interactions with state separated from functions used further up

game.js either contain functions for front-end interaction OR state manipulation, not both!

Mapper: Json object to transfer to fron-end with relevant information

Socket.io connection, simple listeners that connect to the functions

## Everywhere

Remove unused variables in imports

Cleanup comments, better structure

More tests

Potential to use more functional code, map/filter
