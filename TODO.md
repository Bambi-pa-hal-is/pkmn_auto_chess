# TODO

## Check

Cost of dota auto chess upgraded units
    Level 2, type 4 -> sells for 6 (his level) +2 for now

How much hp to lose? 1 point per level of unit
Definitely not, 6 level 6 units would be 36 hp, more like 14 damage from them (6-0)

Check exp required for every level

Check how many pieces in auto chess (different pieces)

Decide if wanted:
Shuffle deck of pieces when 20 (40?) pieces are discarded? Chance for not all pieces should be in every game

## Refactor

game.js either contain functions for front-end interaction OR state manipulation, not both!

Get all close interactions with state separated from functions used further up

## Tests

Test weaknesses applying correctly

Test combos/buffs from types

Abilities: 
Test dot damage functionality
Test lifesteal functionality

## General

Mapper: Json object to transfer to fron-end with relevant information

Socket.io connection, simple listeners that connect to the functions

check Promise.all alternative for loops

.has instead of !f.isUndefined

cleanup async usage, using Promise.all in places where mult√≠ple calculations are needed
 makes it bottleneck on the slowest one
    example: 
    // Promise.all() allows us to send all requests at the same time. 
    let results = await Promise.all([ getValueA, getValueB, getValueC ]); 

Find a way of choosing pokemon in play
    shouldn't play all 151 at once
    1: Ban base types in beginning
    2: Choose (20-40) units to start with

Auto chess: Jynx1 jynx2 jynx3
    drawbacks: jynx2 jynx3
    Jynx2 = jynx level 50, Jynx3 = jynx level 100
    Find math for getting a better version of one pokemon that is balanced and comparable to others evolving

eevee:
    Evolution based on amount of unit types on board

prevent getting more units of same type if you have max of that type

## Items

X-speed, attack etc

Rare Candy - 2 less pokemon required for 

leftovers/lifesteal functionality

## Everywhere

Remove unused variables in imports

Cleanup comments, better structure

More tests

Potential to use more functional code, map/filter
