## Current Notes

max mana? Instead of letting it go over
  Cap at abilityCost? Could work good
  Render frontend max as abilityCost (ez)
  Backend: if(mana + manaInc > abilityCost) newMana = abilityCost  

DecreaseHp from grass buff, what happens if it kills diglett? (10hp)

Lose hp on gym waves? Wanted or not?
  max 3 hp round loss

Level 5 unit upgrades?
  3 zapdos for example => uber zapdos

Flying longer movement
  Assasins?

Speed might be too strong atm
    Buff tanky units

clear chat after a while?

Show bonus information
        Clickable? Hoverable? somehow show it if wanted

DotDamage effect - Arvid had idea for effect

#### Potential balance:

  Geodude 3 -> 2?
  Remove iggly/cleffa trio ? 
    Maybe not, tanky units, need buff in spells, especially for level 3 versions

  magby 4 -> 3?
  Check slowpoke - really slow
  Check dps, damage
